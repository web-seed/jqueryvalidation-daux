This jQuery plugin makes simple clientside form validation easy, whilst still offering plenty of customization options. It makes a good choice if you’re building something new from scratch, but also when you’re trying to integrate something into an existing application with lots of existing markup. The plugin comes bundled with a useful set of validation methods, including URL and email validation, while providing an API to write your own methods. All bundled methods come with default error messages in english and translations into 37 other languages.

* Please post questions to the [official using jQuery Plugins Forum](http://forum.jquery.com/using-jquery-plugins), tagging your question with (at least) "validate". Keep your question short and succinct and provide code when possible; a testpage makes it much more likely that you get an useful answer in a shorter time.
* Please post bug reports and other contributions (enhancements, features, eg. new validation methods) to the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/issues)
